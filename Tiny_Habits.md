# Habit Building Questions and Answers

**Q.1 In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for
you?**\
The most interesting idea for me in this video is the concept of
intentionally starting with a tiny, simple habit---like flossing one
tooth or doing just two push-ups---instead of launching into big,
overwhelming changes. It emphasizes that by anchoring these tiny actions
to existing routines (for example, "after brushing my teeth, I'll do two
push-ups"), you set yourself up for success. And celebrating even these
small wins builds momentum and positive feelings that help the habit
stick.

**Q.2 How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are
M, A and P.**\
Behavior happens when three things come together at the same moment:\
Motivation -- your desire or reason to do the behavior.\
Ability -- how easy it is to do the behavior.\
Prompt -- a cue or trigger that reminds or pushes you to do it.

**Q.3 Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful
completion of habit?**\
Celebration makes you feel good right away.\
That good feeling tells your brain, "this is important, do it again!"\
Over time, your brain connects the positive emotion with the habit, so
it becomes natural and automatic.

**Q.4 In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for
you?**\
The most interesting idea for me in this video was the "1% better every
day" concept. It showed that even small improvements, if done daily, can
grow into big results over time. This made me realize that success is
not about huge changes at once but about small steps that keep adding
up.

**Q.5 What is the book's perspective about Identity?**\
Not just what you want to do. Rather than aiming to run a marathon the
book encourages you to become a runner. This helps align your habits
with your desired identity---and habits are more likely to stick when
they feel like part of who you are.

**Q.6 Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier
to do?**\
Start small -- Do the tiniest version of the habit (like flossing one
tooth or doing one push-up).\
Make it simple -- Remove obstacles so it doesn't feel hard or heavy.\
Anchor it -- Attach the new habit to something you already do (for
example, "After I brush my teeth, I will floss one tooth").\
Celebrate -- Feel good after doing it, so your brain remembers and wants
to do it again.

**Q.7 Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder
to do?**\
Add friction -- Make it less convenient (like keeping junk food on a
high shelf or far away).\
Remove triggers -- Don't keep reminders or prompts around (like turning
off notifications).\
Make it costly -- Add effort, time, or steps before you can do it.

**Q.8 Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the
steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit
more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?**\
Cue obvious -- Keep the book on my desk or bed so I see it often.\
Make it attractive -- Choose books I really enjoy or topics I love.\
Make it easy -- Start with just 5 minutes of reading a day.\
Make it satisfying -- Mark progress in a journal or celebrate finishing
a few pages.

**Q.9 Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of?
What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible
or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?**\
Make cue invisible -- Keep the phone in another room.\
Make it unattractive -- Turn screen to black & white so it looks
boring.\
Make it hard -- Log out of apps or add extra steps to open them.\
Make it unsatisfying -- Tell a friend to check on me so I feel bad if I
waste time.
