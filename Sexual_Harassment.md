# Q.1 What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment happens when someone makes another person feel uncomfortable, unsafe, or disrespected in a sexual way.  
Some common behaviours that cause it are:

- **Unwanted touching** – like hugging, patting, or brushing against someone without their consent.  
- **Dirty jokes or comments** – saying sexual things or making fun in a way that offends.  
- **Staring or leering** – looking at someone’s body in a way that makes them feel uneasy.  
- **Unwanted messages** – sending sexual texts, photos, or emails.  
- **Asking for sexual favours** – directly or indirectly, especially in return for something (like work benefits).  
- **Displaying sexual content** – showing photos, videos, or materials that are sexual.  
- **Following or blocking** – making someone feel trapped or stalked in a sexual way.

# Q.2 What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If I ever face or witness sexual harassment, I would stay calm and try to move to a safe place.  
I would make it clear to the person that such behaviour is not acceptable.  
I would write down the details of what happened and then immediately report the matter to the right authority like a teacher, HR, Internal Complaints Committee or higher officer.  
I would also talk to someone I trust for support.  
If I see someone else being harassed, I would not stay silent but stand by them, help them speak up, and make sure the issue is reported.
